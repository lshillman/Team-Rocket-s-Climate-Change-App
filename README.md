# Interstellar Generation Ship Feasibility Calculator

## Check out the [deployed app](https://lshillman.github.io/generation-ship-calculator/)

This is a calculator that you, a government representative can use to determine whether an offworld colony ship is feasible, given your GDP and space program budget.

Or that you, a wealthy private individual with disproportionate access to planetary resources, can use to determine whether you could fund such an endeavor out of your personal coffers.

This is ~~based on~~ _inspired by_ work by Project Hyperion, a two-year study on the feasibility of a crewed interstellar flight. Project Hyperion's math was not entirely grokkable for us given our timeframe to develop this, so we have greatly simplified the calculations.
